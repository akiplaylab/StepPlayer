# StepPlayer

This repository is a personal research project for studying rhythm game mechanics
and real-time feedback systems.

This repository focuses on **technical exploration**, not recreating any
commercial game or assets.

---

## What this project explores

- Rhythm game timing & judgement systems
- Audio synchronization
- UI / feedback experiments
- Optional hardware feedback via Razer Chroma

---

## Razer Chroma (Optional)

This project includes **experimental integration** with Razer Chroma devices
using the Unity SDK.

- Lighting reacts to judgement results only
- Fully optional (game works without Chroma)
- Static colors, event-based feedback

### Emulator support

You can test Chroma output **without physical hardware** using:

https://github.com/WyvrnOfficial/ChromaEmulator

This is recommended for development, testing, and CI environments.
